"""
This module contains several sampling options that can be used when drawing random values for mutations.

Some of the sampling options in this module can be considered `base-samplers`. This means that they produce a set
of values without requiring any input. The remaining options will have a ``base_sampler`` optional argument, as they
need input from some other sampler to produce values, as they perform operations on them such as mirroring.

Base samplers
=============
* :class:`~GaussianSampling`
* :class:`~QuasiGaussianHaltonSampling`
* :class:`~QuasiGaussianSobolSampling`

Indirect samplers
=================
* :class:`~MirroredSampling`
* :class:`~OrthogonalSampling`
* :class:`~MirroredOrthogonalSampling`
